# Azure-Data-Factory-Mapping-Data-Flow-Workshop

## What is Azure Data Factory?

Azure Data Factory is Azure's cloud ETL service for scale-out serverless data integration and data transformation. It offers a code-free UI for intuitive authoring and single-pane-of-glass monitoring and management.

Note that another product within Azure, Synapse Pipelines, is synonomous with Azure Data Factory. In most instances, these two products share the same code base. While this repository uses Azure Data Factory for demonstration purposes, the lessons and concepts can be applied to Synapse Pipelines as well.

## What is Azure Data Factory Mapping Data Flows?

This repository specificially focuses on the Mapping Data Flows feature within Azure Data Factory, or "ADF". Mapping Data Flows is a feature that allows data engineers to visually design, debug, manage, and operationalize data transformations at scale in the cloud.
