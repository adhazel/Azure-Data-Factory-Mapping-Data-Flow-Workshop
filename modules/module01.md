# Module 01 - Create Integration Runtimes and Linked Services

[< Previous Module](../modules/module00.md) - **[Home](../README.md)** - [Next Module >](../modules/module03.md)

## :loudspeaker: Introduction
The Integration Runtime (IR) is the compute infrastructure used by Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse pipelines. For more information about integration runtimes, see [Integration runtime in Azure Data Factory](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-factory/concepts-integration-runtime).

In this workshop, the default Azure Integration Runtime is used, along with Managed Virtual Network. Azure integration runtime provides a fully managed, serverless compute in Azure. You don't have to worry about infrastructure provision, software installation, patching, or capacity scaling. In addition, you only pay for the duration of the actual utilization. The enablement of Managed Virtual Network allows you to use the power of spark within mapping data flows.

Once integration runtimes exist, the next step is to create linked services to the resources the data factory connects to. Linked services are referenced by datasets and activities.
