## :loudspeaker: Introduction

according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slowly_changing_dimension): a slowly changing dimension (SCD) in data management and data warehousing is a dimension which contains relatively static data which can change slowly but unpredictably, rather than according to a regular schedule. Typical examples are the family name change of an employee after marrige and address change of a customer, which all happens unpredictably.

Based on how to deal with a slowly dimensional data change in different scenarios, there are several [SCD Types](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/populate-slowly-changing-dimensions-azure-synapse-analytics-pipelines/3-choose-between-dimension-types). The most frequently used are SCD Type 1 and SCD Type 2, which will be introduced in this module together with the implementation pattern in Azure Data Factory Mapping Data Flow. 


* Slowly Changing Dimensions Type 1 (overwrite without tracking history)
* Slowly Changing Dimensions Type 2 (track history by adding new row)

## 1. Introduction SCD Type 1 and SCD Type 2

The pipelines in this module use a 5 MB file named *NYCTripSmall.parquet*. This file needs to be in the Azure Storage Account created for this lab.

### SCD Type 1
A Type 1 SCD always reflects the latest values, and when changes in source data are detected, the dimension table data is overwritten. This design approach is common for columns that store supplementary values, like the email address or phone number of a customer. When a customer email address or phone number changes, the dimension table updates the customer row with the new values. It's as if the customer always had this contact information. The key field, such as CustomerID, would stay the same so the records in the fact table automatically link to the updated customer record.
